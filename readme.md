# Calinga-Nodejs-Demo
### A simple example to demonstrate the usage of i18next with Calinga in a nodejs backend project.

## Before you start:
You will need an API key if your project in Calinga is not public. For more information on how to obtain an API Key, please visit Calinga's [User Manual](https://docs.calinga.io/#/project-api-tokens)

After creating a project, install the `i18next-calinga-backend` from npm as follows:
